# Kotlin-Jetpack-TODO-app
Android app that utilizes the Jetpack libraries and Android Architecture Components.

A Kotlin TODO app that utilizes modern android Jetpack libraries with MVVM design pattern
and clean architecture. The app uses Android Architecture Components and Hilt for dependency
injection.

This is my first app written purely in Kotlin so the app is simple and lightweight but also
incompasses some fundamental concepts of modern Android development.
